Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages
 which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops,
 functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
frozenset
Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:

import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))
